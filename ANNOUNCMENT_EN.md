My brother Dominik and me (Patrik) are working the last couple weeks to bring DeFiChain to your phone. 
The current implementation is still a work in progress.

We wanted to let the community to know about it. We are working hard on it, and we want to release it as soon as possible. 

# Smart DeFi Wallet

* Ready to use right after installation. Blockchain is managed by a server (like Mycelium).

* Liquidity Mining - Add & Remove Liquitidy shares
* DEX - Swap pairs on the go
* [OpenSource](https://github.com/DeFiCh-WalletApp/WalletApp)
