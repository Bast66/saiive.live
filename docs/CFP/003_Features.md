# Describe the purpose
We have implemented several features which are unplanned from our initial roadmap. Therefore we want to propose a CFP to compensate the development costs of those features.

- Jellyfish compatibility
- Manage serveral accounts
- Pub/Priv key import
- Priv key export
- Addressbook for sending
- Expert mode
	- Choose return address while making operations
- Transaction history export (WIP)
- DFX integration (WIP - waiting on the DFX team)

We also want to provide a roadmap on what to come next:
- Stocks/Loans
- Atomic Swap
- Ledger integration
Those are the big features that we are planing and implementing in the next couple weeks/months.

We also improved our infrastructure. The new explorer is not yet finished but reachable at [Explorer](https://explorer.saiive.live).
We have changed the api calls we need to fetch the data. The explorer now also uses our supernode api!

We support 
- **DeFiChain Mainnet**
- **DeFiChain Testnet**
- **Bitcoin Mainnet**
- **Bitcoin Testnet**
with this version of the explorer. 

# How will the fund be spent?
Compensation for the work put into the features.


# How does this CFP benefit the DeFiChain community?
A more advanced wallet with easy to use features and top support.
