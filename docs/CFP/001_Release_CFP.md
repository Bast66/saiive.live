As you already know - we have released the first mobile wallet for DeFiChain under the name "[saiive.live](https://saiive.live)". 

Now we want to propose for a funding within the next round of voting. Here is our CFP. I hope that we have reached your expectations on the wallet and would love to develop it further with and for the community :)

Dominik und Patrik are actively developing a Light, non custodial Wallet for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows and Linux.  (https://github.com/saiive).

**saiive.live** is a non-custodial light wallet Application that runs on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and Linux. In it's current stage, it is fully functional and already working.

The goal of this project is not just to provide a mobile application to the DefiChain Ecosystem, it is much more. It includes many necessary components to further decentralize DeFiChain and move away from the Foundation and Cake, enhancing also security and future possible prjects. Our application solves one of the main problems running the foundation app on desktop.



# Release
## Current Status

 The app is fully functioning and has already implementing following functions:
 - Offline signing of BTC transactions
 - Offline signing of DFI transactions
 - Send DAT and DFI (Converting account to UTXO if necessary)
 - Receiving of DAT and DFI
 - Receiving of Bitcoin (for atomic swap - coming later)
 - HD Wallet Implementation
    - Supporting only 1 account for now, later on you can create as many as wanted
 - Show Balance of $DFI and DAT
 - DEX:
   - Swap DFI to DAT
   - Swap DAT to DFI
   - Create Transaction and send it to Blockchain
 - Liquidity Mining:
   - Show all available Pools with Liquidity
   - Show my Pools Shares
   - Calculate estimated earnings for my pool shares
   - Add Liquidity
   - Remove Liquidity
 - List all Tokens
 - Settings
   - Show Seed
   - Remove Seed
   - Change Theme (Dark and Light Mode)
   - Biotmetric Security for FaceID/TouchID or Fingerprint on Android / PIN on all Devices
   - Mainnet and Testnet
 - Secure Storage for Mmenonic Seed on Mobile devices through system provided Secure Storage Systems. Encrypted on Desktop OS

For the app to be functional, we also provide the necessary infrastructure which currently is distributed into several data centers. This infrastructure consists of following services:
 - Full Node in testnet
 - Full Node in mainnet
 - Bitcore as a proxy API and database for blocks/transactions
 - Supernode as our Web3 API
 - Running on different Cloud providers
 - DEV/TEST/PROD environment to be indepentend from dev and test
Check the [DeFiChain-Wiki](https://defichain-wiki.com/wiki/Saiive.live) for more informations about that!



### How does this CFP benefit the DeFiChain community?

No more:

* Resync
* Initial sync
* high-end device to run the app

I guess the benefits of our app should be clear to all :)


# How will the fund be spent?

Mostly for infrastructure and employees.
Even if we were against the 5/10y masternode locking - we will create at least 1 masternode and lock the funds for 5years to show long-term commitment to the project. With the rewards from the masternodes we will pay the infrastructure and employee costs.
