# Describe the purpose
Jellyfish and the Light Wallet choose to implement a different kind of algorithm to generate new addresses. Therefore our wallet and the cake light wallet was not compatible. We want to provide a seemless switch from the light wallet to the saiive.wallet and probably vice versa.

Therefore we looked into the jellyfish code and figured out how the address generation was implemented. After days of work we figured out the what has been changed from the core team and we were able to implement it into our wallet as well.


# How will the fund be spent?
Compensation for the work put into the compatbility mode. 


# How does this CFP benefit the DeFiChain community?
A seemless and easy switch between different wallets.
